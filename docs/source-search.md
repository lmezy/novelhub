# Source Search

Source search completes the P0 loop: import book source -> search novel ->
fetch chapters -> download content -> storage/database/search -> web reader.

## How it works

1. Import a YueDu (Legado) book source through Admin -> Book Source Import.
2. Open the Search page and switch to Book Sources mode.
3. Pick a source, enter a keyword, and search.
4. Results are parsed with the source's `searchUrl` and `ruleSearch`.
5. Each result is checked against the local library (`in_library`).
6. Admin users can click Sync to download the book into NovelHub.

## API

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8088/api/sources/yuedu_xxx/search?q=keyword&page=1&limit=30" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

Response:

```json
{
  "source_id": "yuedu_xxx",
  "source_name": "Example Source",
  "query": "keyword",
  "page": 1,
  "total": 2,
  "results": [
    {
      "source_id": "yuedu_xxx",
      "source_name": "Example Source",
      "name": "Book One",
      "author": "Author",
      "url": "https://example.com/novel/123.html",
      "cover_url": null,
      "intro": "Description",
      "kind": "fantasy",
      "latest_chapter": "Chapter 10",
      "word_count": null,
      "in_library": false,
      "book_id": null
    }
  ]
}
```

Then sync a remote result:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8088/api/sync/book" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"source_id":"yuedu_xxx","url":"https://example.com/novel/123.html"}'
```

## Rule compatibility

The search implementation follows Legado behavior:

- `{{key}}` / `{{page}}` and legacy `searchKey` / `searchPage` placeholders.
- Page arithmetic expressions such as `{{(page-1)*12}}`.
- URL option suffix such as `,{"method":"POST","body":{...}}`.
- POST JSON bodies, extra headers, cookies, retries, and proxy fallback.
- Legado CSS shorthand selectors: `tag.xxx`, `class.xxx`, `id.xxx`,
  `text.xxx`, `children.xxx`, `@` chains, `-`/`+` list prefixes, index
  selectors (`option.0`, `option!0`, `option[-1]`), and `##` regex suffixes.
- `bookUrlPattern` filtering so category/search/navigation links are not
  returned as novels.
- Generic list parsing fallback when the configured `ruleSearch` misses the
  live page markup.

## Verification

1. `docker compose up -d --build`
2. Log in as admin.
3. Admin -> Book Source Import -> paste a source URL or JSON.
4. Search page -> Book Sources -> search a keyword.
5. Sync a result and open it in the reader.
